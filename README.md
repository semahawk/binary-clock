# Binary clock

Just for-fun project :)
There will be more content as the development goes further.

The basic goal is to make a binary clock, which uses JavaScript, and [MooTools](http://mootools.net/) framework.
Maybe I'll think of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) version, but thats 10100% confirmed.

Have fun! (when it's done, of course)
